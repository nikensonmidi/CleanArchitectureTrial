The Infastrcuture layer should only have input/output components
While Core has the business logic (which includes validations and queries and commands) it does not have
the actual implementation of the persistence of the data or where that is coming from.
That is where the infrastructure layer comes into play.
The infrastructure layer dictates where the data is being stored or retrieved from.
That can be SQL server in which case a project for SQL DB would be created within the 
infrastructure layer. Or it can be NoSQL with MongoDB, in which case a MongoDB project
would be created. The same goes for files and other data stores.
In addition, other services such as Logging support might rest here as well within the infrastructure layer.
